### Covid-19 Death Distribution Dashboarrd

This dashboard is a demonstration of my ability to use Github as well as show
part of a project I have recently been working on for the class DACSS 604.

### Visualization

```{r warning=FALSE}
readRDS("histogram_plot.rds")
```

### Key Observations

This chart utilized data from 
[Our World in Data: COVID-19](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)
It shows the distribution of Deaths per million people for countries across
the world. As we can see, most countries appear to have deaths under
2,000 per million people. However, there is a significant right skew to the data
with one value even greater than 6,000. Further analysis will reveal if economic
status has a correlation to these outliers. Furthermore, I am skeptical of the 
data centered near and at zero and wonder instead if this is a problem with
reporting.
