# ProfessionalProfile
This assignment is designed to help you showcase your personal and project-related work by building a professional GitHub page and linking it to a dashboard presentation based on one of your existing projects. You just need to submit the link of your created GitHub page so that I read your files and codes(5%); the personal webpage should also be published and can be accessed (5%).
 
Instructions: 
Part 1: Create a GitHub Page
Create a GitHub Page using the repository feature on GitHub as I showed you in the lecture. You can check out my webpage_demo repository for reference: https://github.com/dongericoyu/webpage-demo.

Your personal GitHub page should at least include the following components:

1. An About Me page (index.html): all components should be able to opened and displayed in the correct format as the course demo website shows (5%).
Upload your personal profile picture (10%).
Provide a brief self-introduction  (e.g., academic background, areas of interest); Don't just type short phrase or bullet points; make the complete sentences (10%).
Include a clickable that links to your resume/CV. Attach your resume/CV as a downloadable link or embedded document.

(If you don't have one, you can attach a PDF file of anything, such as the course materials or syllabus) (10%). 
2. A Project page (projct.html): 
List at least one of the data-driven projects you worked or are working on. Provide brief description about the project (no more than 100-word) for each of them (10%).
Provide a clickable links to the projects, such as the GitHub repository, the analysis with tables, visualizations, and writings (standalone .html page)（10%）. 
Part 2: Create a Dashboard Presentation: the dashboard should be presented in the correct format, not a regular html page format (5%).
Select one of your completed or ongoing projects;
Create a using software or tools of your choice (e.g., flex dashboard in R Markdown is suggested; if you want to try to embed a Shiny App, you can use Shiny Dashboard to do it; other options: Tableau, Power BI, Python Dash, etc.);  (10%).
For demonstration, just include one visualization/chart(10%), and a few text prose/brief description of the chart in this dashboard（10%). 
Add a link to the dashboard on your or embed it directly (if supported) .
